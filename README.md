# i3blocks-Ultimate-Setup

Welcome to **i3blocks-Ultimate-Setup** — a thoughtfully crafted, minimal yet feature-rich status bar configuration for the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/). This setup is designed for users who value **minimalism**, **clarity**, and **efficiency**. Every block is engineered to provide essential system information at a glance, while keeping system resource usage exceptionally low.

---

## Why Minimalism?

Our i3blocks configuration is built with minimalism at its core. Each script is lightweight, written in POSIX shell, and avoids unnecessary dependencies. This ensures your system remains fast and responsive, with the status bar consuming only a tiny fraction of your resources — perfect for both modern and older hardware.

---

## How It Works

- **i3blocks** reads the `config` file and executes each block’s script at a set interval.
- Each script outputs three lines:  
  1. **Main text** (displayed in the bar)  
  2. **Short text** (optional, not used here)  
  3. **Color** (for the block background)
- All scripts are located in `~/.config/i3blocks/scripts/` and are optimized for minimal CPU and memory usage.
